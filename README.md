# memory-match-game

## Description

A Sailor Moon themed memory matching card game made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Instructions

1. Clicking on a card "flips" the card over showing a Font Awesome icon and starts a timer.
2. Clicking on another card flips it. 2 flips of the card = 1 move. If the cards match, they remain displayed, if not, they are flipped back over.
3. Users begin with a 5-star rating. Once the user has reached 18 moves, their rating is reduced 1/2 for each move.
4. The user can hit the refresh button to restart the game at any time.
5. When the user has matched all of the cards, a modal appears giving them the option to start a new game, which will flip back over the cards and shuffle them.
